# Unpublished Flatpak manifests

Personal Flatpak manifests I've written for anyone that wants to maintain

Here are the Flatpak manifests I've written:
- [ProtonVPN](https://github.com/TheEvilSkeleton/flatpaks/tree/com.protonvpn.ProtonVPN) - Doesn't work, but launches
- [Logisim](https://github.com/TheEvilSkeleton/flatpaks/tree/net.sourceforge.carlburch.Logisim) - Works
- [Spigot](https://github.com/TheEvilSkeleton/flatpaks/tree/org.spigotmc.Spigot) - Works for the most part
